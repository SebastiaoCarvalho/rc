RC WORD GAME

This project consists on an classic hangman word game using a client and a server communicating via socket interface.


To run this project, write "make" on your terminal to compile it and the execute it the following way:

Server
- to run the server write ./server word_file [-p GSport] [-v] , where word_file is the name of your file that contains the words and image names used.
- the server has the following flags:
    -v: execute on verbose mode
    -p PORT: select a custom port number for your server to use, default is 58002
    -s: set the reading for the word file to sequential reading. When not used, reading is random.
- the timer for server tcp connection is located in the main function of server.cpp between line 225 and 229.
- the server uses a function called bootServer that erases all pending game files and previous scores when the server starts. If you wish to change this function to only erase game files or not erase any files at all, the function is located in server.cpp line 344
- the server also uses a function called createDirs to create essential directories if they are ever removed. Please don't remove this funtion or the program may abort.

Player
- to run the player write ./player [-n GSIP] [-p GSport]
- the player has the following flags:
    -p PORT: change the port where your server is, default is 58002
    -n IP: change the IP address where your server is, default is localhost (127.0.0.1)
- the timers for the udp and tcp commands are implemented in the following functions of the client.cpp file : "rcvMessageUdp" and "readTcp" located on the lines 567 and 803, respectively. To deactivate the timers the variable "tv.tv_sec" must be set to 0 in each function. To increase or deacrese the timeout time, the "tv.tv_sec" and "tv.tv_usec" can be set to bigger values, taking into account that the first one represents time in seconds and the second represents time in microseconds.

All images used for hint files are stored on a folder called images. If you wish to add new images to your game you need to add them to the images folder or they won't be recognized and hint command will fail. Please don't remove this direcotry. The program only works if the image files are in this directory.

There are 2 directories named GAMES and SCORES that are used for storing game files and scores of games. These directories should't be deleted in any case. If you wish to remove all game files manually remove only the files and not the whole directories. The same applies for score files.
